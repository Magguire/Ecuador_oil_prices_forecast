# Ecuador Oil Prices Forecasting with Python

- This project aims to understand fluctuations of oil prices in Ecuador which is a country prone to natural disasters such as earthquakes and volcanic eruptions

## Impact of Flactuating Oil Prices on the Favorita stores in Ecuador.
Ecuador is a country located in the coast of the North western region of Southern America. It's capital is Quito city. The larger population of Eucador is latin Americans.

In this study, we will be predicting the sales of Favorita Stores in Ecuador. Ecuador is a major petroleum exporter. It is also prone to earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, and tsunamis. The most recent major earthquake was on April 16th, 2016. The most recent was 2022-03-26 which had minor damage.

The impact of the unbalanced natural phenomena is especially felt on oil production and pricing, which in turn affects sales. To reduce the impact of the negative consequences, the sales managers, through a team of data scientists, decided to do a prediction of sales by predicting oil price fluctuations so that Favorita Stores can prepare accordingly for the expected oil price fluctuations caused by the earthquakes.

## Research Question
### a.) Defining the question
To determine the oil price trend for pre and post the major earthquake phenomena in 2016 in order to predict future oil prices which will enable Favorita store owners to prepare accordingly.

### b.) Defining metric for success
Success of the project will be determined by ability to correctly predict daily oil prices in Ecuador therefore shading a light to Favorita store owners on what to expect in the future.

### c.) Understanding the context
We are required to define the trend of oil prices before the earthquake and after the earthquake then predict future oil prices. Our conclusion and recommendations will be based on our findings.

### d.) Recording the experimental design
i.) Importing libraries necessary for analysis.

ii.) Reading the datasets.

iii.) Previewing datasets and their information.

iv.) Data cleaning procedures; checking and dealing with outliers and anomalies, imputing null values, deleting duplicates, converting columns into appropriate datatypes, checking and removing whitespaces and renaming column appropriately.

v.) Perform univariate and bivariate exploratory data analysis.

vi.) Implement the solution; hypothesis testing and time series analysis.

vii.) Make conclusions based on findings

viii.) Give recommendations.

### e.) Data Relevance
The dataset file contains datasets for oil prices, sales, transactions, holidays, stores and family products(train and test datasets).

Combining the datasets results in a dated dataset from 2013 to 2017 which can be used in hypothesis testing and time series analysis, and prediction of oil prices.
